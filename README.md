## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Install Poetry

If you haven't installed Poetry yet, follow the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Install Dependencies

Use Poetry to install project dependencies and create a virtual environment:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

### Starting the Development Environment

Activate the Poetry shell to work within the project's virtual environment:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Running the Server

Start the Flask backend server using the `server.py` script:

```bash
python app/server.py
```

### Accessing the Frontend

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the frontend interface. The frontend communicates with the Flask backend via REST API to fetch and display data from PubMed.

```

## Testing

The `tests` folder includes scripts for performance testing and quick API validations. These tests are optional and primarily used for ensuring the application performs efficiently and the API endpoints function correctly.

### Executing Tests

#### Ensure the Server is Running

Start the server in a terminal:

```bash
python app/server.py
```

#### Run the Performance Tests

Open another terminal within the Poetry shell and execute the performance test script:

```bash
python tests/performance/performance_test.py
```

This script compares the performance of the original and optimized functions for fetching PubMed articles.

#### Run the API Tests

In the Poetry shell, execute the API test script:

```bash
python tests/test_api.py
```

This script performs a quick validation of the `/search` endpoint to ensure it returns the expected results.

*Note*: The tests rely on the backend server being active to function correctly.

## Design Details

- **Virtual Environment Management**: Poetry ensures that all dependencies are isolated within the project's virtual environment, preventing conflicts with other Python projects.
- **API Configuration**: The `config/pubmed_config.py` file manages the configuration for interacting with the PubMed API, including base URLs, default parameters, search parameters, and rate limiting settings.
- **Rate Limiting and Caching**: The `app/pubmed.py` module implements rate limiting to control the frequency of API requests and uses caching to store recent search results, enhancing performance.
- **Frontend Interaction**: The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, communicates with the Flask backend via REST API to fetch and display research articles based on user queries.
- **Logging and Debugging**: The Flask server is set to run in debug mode (`debug=True`) for easier troubleshooting during development. Logs can be enhanced further by integrating Pythonâ€™s logging module as needed.
- **Extensibility**: The project structure is modular, allowing for easy addition of new features, routes, or tests. Unused components, like the `LoadingAnimation.jsx`, are included for potential future enhancements.
